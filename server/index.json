A Hierarchical Key Assignment Scheme (HKAS) is designed to cryptographically enforce access control in hierarchical structures. It operates by assigning secrets and encryption keys to a set of classes within a partially ordered hierarchy. This approach ensures that the secret of a higher-level class can be used to efficiently derive keys for all classes positioned at a lower level in the hierarchy. In this paper, we introduce a novel cryptographic primitive that we name HKAS with Key Rotation (KR-HKAS). This extension enhances the current HKAS framework by enabling a provably secure mechanism for periodically rotating both encryption keys and secrets, without necessitating a complete setup reset. This proactive approach effectively mitigates the risk of security breaches due to compromised cryptographic material, aligning with the best security practice.","tags":[],"title":"Hierarchical Key Assignment Schemes with Key Rotation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberta Cimorelli Belfiore","Andrea De Cosmo","Anna Lisa Ferrara"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1708041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1708041600,"objectID":"cf94059a633614386a99ba214586b639","permalink":"/publication/acns/","publishdate":"2024-01-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/acns/","section":"publication","summary":"Identity-Based Matchmaking Encryption (IB-ME), initially proposed by Ateniese et al. (Crypto 2019), is an extension of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) that emphasizes privacy and authenticity. It ensures that the content of a message is only revealed when the recipient‚Äôs identity matches the intended recipient specified by the sender, and when the target sender‚Äôs identity, chosen by the receiver during decryption, matches the actual sender‚Äôs identity. In cases where there is a mismatch, no information about the sender, receiver, or message is disclosed. Francati et al. (IndoCrypt 2021) observed that the privacy definition for IB-ME solely guarantees the concealment of the message and sender identity when the receiver‚Äôs identity does not match the intended recipient specified by the sender. It does not consider whether the target sender‚Äôs identity matches the actual sender‚Äôs identity. To overcome this limitation, they proposed an enhanced privacy notion and developed an IB-ME scheme that achieves it in the plain model, even though relying on non-standard assumptions. In this paper, we address the problem of constructing an IB-ME scheme that offers enhanced privacy under standard assumptions with particular emphasis on post quantum security. Specifically, we first show how to obtain an IB-ME that achieves the notion of enhanced privacy using as building blocks any anonymous IBE and reusable computational extractors. Next, we show how to construct an IB-ME starting from an IB-ME satisfying enhanced privacy and a context-hiding homomorphic signature, thereby ensuring not only enhanced privacy but also authenticity. Notably, our framework allows for secure IB-ME schemes to be instantiated in the standard model from lattice assumptions, thus providing also post-quantum security.","tags":[],"title":"Identity-Based Matchmaking Encryption from Standard Lattice Assumptions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Honored with the 2024 ACNS Student Travel Grant at the 22nd International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security.\n","date":1706054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706054400,"objectID":"0469df366cfb72799bf44281e074c28f","permalink":"/awards/acns-travel-grant/","publishdate":"2024-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/awards/acns-travel-grant/","section":"awards","summary":"Honored with the 2024 ACNS Student Travel Grant at the 22nd International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security.","tags":null,"title":"2024 ACNS Student Travel Grant","type":"awards"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

Over the past decade, researchers have focused on developing access control policies and evaluating their efficacy in preventing unauthoized access. A new variant of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), called Extended Generalized Role-Based Access Control (EGRBAC), has recently been introduced to capture the intricate user-device- context interactions that are prevalent in smart home environments. In this paper, we demonstrate that the task of analyzing administrative EGRBAC policies for security can be performed by reducing it to the security analysis of administrative RBAC policies. We also conducted a case study on a realistic smart home to prove the viability of our approach with respect to security requirements such as availability and privilege escalation.","tags":[],"title":"Security Analysis of Access Control Policies for Smart Homes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberta Cimorelli Belfiore","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
