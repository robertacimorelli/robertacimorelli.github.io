abstract="Identity-Based Matchmaking Encryption (IB-ME), initially proposed by Ateniese et al. (Crypto 2019), is an extension of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) that emphasizes privacy and authenticity. It ensures that the content of a message is only revealed when the recipient's identity matches the intended recipient specified by the sender, and when the target sender's identity, chosen by the receiver during decryption, matches the actual sender's identity. In cases where there is a mismatch, no information about the sender, receiver, or message is disclosed.",
